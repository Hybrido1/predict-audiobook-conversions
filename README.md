# predict-audiobook-conversions
Predicting audiobook purchases using a neural network trained on user behavior data. Built with TensorFlow to model behavioral patterns and uncover insights for customer conversion.

📚 Audiobook Purchase Prediction using Neural Networks
This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning approach using a deep neural network to predict whether a customer will convert (i.e., purchase an audiobook) based on behavioral and usage data.

🔍 Objective
To build a classification model that can identify potential audiobook buyers by analyzing historical user behavior patterns. The ultimate goal is to assist businesses in targeting high-potential customers, optimizing marketing strategies, and enhancing conversion rates.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is a structured CSV file (Audiobooks_data.csv) containing anonymized data points such as:

Number of times the app was opened

Number of minutes listened

Completion rate

Total purchases

And more...

The last column indicates whether the user converted (1) or not (0).

🧠 Techniques & Tools
Python 3

NumPy & Pandas for data manipulation

TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the neural network

Matplotlib for basic visualization

Data Preprocessing: Normalization, train/validation/test split, and one-hot encoding

🏗️ Model Architecture
Input layer based on feature count

Hidden layers: 2 dense layers with ReLU activation

Output layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Metrics: Accuracy

🧪 Results
Achieved high accuracy on both validation and test datasets, showing the model’s generalizability and effectiveness in predicting customer conversion likelihood.

📊 Key Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with preprocessing real-world data

Practical application of classification techniques using neural networks

Understanding model evaluation and avoiding overfitting

Translating business goals into actionable ML pipelines

🚀 Future Enhancements
Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

Integrate user demographic data for improved predictions

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for interactive use

📌 Why This Project Matters
With the surge in digital audio content, businesses need intelligent systems to forecast consumer behavior. This project showcases the practical use of AI to drive sales and user engagement—skills that are directly relevant for roles in data science, machine learning, and business analytics.
